      <h2>Design Space Lab <a href="demo.html">Prototype</a></h2>
      <p>
        For my final project, I intend to build a interactive visualization tool to help architects, engineers, and
        product designers
        explore design spaces in a performance-driven way.
        A design space is defined by design variables/parameters, which control the design geometry. For a given set of
        design variables, the resulting geometry of
        the design can be evaluated based on the function that the design needs to fulfill.
        For example, if we define a design space for a roof truss, we would like it to be as lightweight as possible to
        reduce cost and material consumption. In this case, weight is our performance metric, and it is affected by the
        geometry of the truss, itself
        controlled by design variables. Exploring the relationship between the design variables, the objective, and the
        design geometry is key to
        converging to a good design option.
        This exploration can be done manually, but it is usually too tedious to be effective. Another option is to use
        optimization, which may or may not
        return the optimal answer (given objective functions used in design are rarely convex), but optimization will
        typically not be able to take into
        account unquantifiable criteria of importance, say aesthetic appeal, which require a human designer to be
        assessed.
        An alternative is thus to sample the design space and visualize it. The trick here is to not only visualize the
        relationship between design variables and
        objectives but also to visualize the design geometry itself.
        By using parallel coordinate and trellis plots, the prototype I built for assignment 3 offers a first strategy
        to do so.
      </p>
      <h3>Dataset</h3>
      <p>
        The prototype is intended to be broadly applicable to different design problems. For the purpose of this demo,
        I built a design space that generates roof trusses based on 5 input variables. Using that design space, I
        automatically
        sampled 500 trusses, which were evaluated for weight. In addition, I took a screenshot of the front and side
        views of each truss geometry.
        To summarize, we have 500 datapoints of the form <i>[x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>, x<sub>4</sub>,
          x<sub>5</sub>, w]</i>
        with an associated image <i>glyph-#.png</i>.
      </p>

      <h3>Interface</h3>
      <p>
        The interface of the prototype is not necessarily meant to be understood at first glance, as it required a
        fairly involved set of charts to offer
        a full(ish) picture of the dataset, which is what I was after. To help you navigate the demo, the diagrams below
        show the interface and some of the key features of the prototype.

      <h3>Design choices</h3>


      <ul>
        <p>
          <h4>Choice of color encoding</h4>
          To maintain an instantaneous visual assessment of the performance of a specific design, I opted to use color
          to encode performance. I also tried to
          work with size, but it simply was not legible as the paths in the parallel coordinate plot are highly
          entangled.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h4>Curved paths</h4>
          Instead of using polylines for each desing in the parallel plot, I chose to use curved paths because the
          associated smoothness
          makes it easier to track a specific path.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h4>Information scent with kernel density estimation</h4>
          The additional density information helps in quickly assessing the density of paths when there is overlap. It
          also makes the parallel coordinate plot
          less boring.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h4>Alignment of axes</h4>
          The dimensions in the parallel coordinate plot and the rows of the scatter plot matrix share the same axes,
          clarifying the overall layout of
          the visualization.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h4>Alignment of axes</h4>
          The dimensions in the parallel coordinate plot and the rows of the scatter plot matrix share the same axes,
          clarifying the overall layout of
          the visualization.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h4>Design glyph on hover</h4>
          When hovering over a datapoint, the user will see an image of the design, which is critical to assess a desing
          beyond its numerical score.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h4>Automatic rescaling option</h4>
          I knew it would be important to provide a way to zoom in on specific regions of the design space. I decided to
          make all the filtering happen
          in the parallel coordinate plot for simplicity and clarity. While I am still considering allowing to zoom in
          the scatter plots in a future iteration,
          I believe the parallel plot is a nice way to control each variable independtly, similarly to sliders.
          Sometimes, however, a user may want to have a global view of the space and can disable to option to do so.
        </p>
      </ul>

      </p>
      <h3>Design Development</h3>
      <p>
        Since I worked on my own, I did not necessarily track time while working, but it definitely took a few days,
        mostly because I had never used d3 before, and
        it can be counter-intuitive at times. I improved my initial design progressively as I developed the
        prototype, but I spent a lot of time working on the interactions, and I certaibly did not explore as many design
        alternatives as I had wished.
      </p>
      <h3>Improvements</h3>
      <ul>
        <p>
          <h4>Performance</h4>
          The prototype suffers from slight performance issues when filtering many paths at once. In the future, I plan
          on making some of the functions called
          upon brushing asynchronous.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h4>Complexity</h4>
          Overall, the visualization may be a bit overdesigned. It is fairly complex and may be hard to comprehend. In
          addition, I observed, at least in the present
          dataset, some of the plots in the scatter plot matrix are not super useful.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h4>Difficulty in hovering</h4>
          Hovering over a particular datapoint is not particularly easy, and perhaps I should scale up the circles upon
          zoom.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h4>Scalability</h4>
          The prototype works because this design space only included 5 input variables. I probably have to rethink the
          visualization to make it scalable
          to 10+ variables.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h4>Desing Comparison</h4>
          As I was playing with the prototype, I realized that the design visualization feature is underutilized. Specifically, I believe designers would 
          prefer to compare multiple designs at once.
        </p>
      </ul>
